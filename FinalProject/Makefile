### Variables for this project ###
# These should be the only ones that need to be modified
# The files that must be compiled, with a .o extension
OBJECTS = mongoose.o
# The header files
DEPENDS = mongoose.h
# The executable programs to be created
MONGOOSE = multithreaded

MAIN = web-server

### Variables for the compilation rules ###
# These should work for most projects, but can be modified when necessary
# The compiler program to use
CC = gcc
# Options to use when compiling object files
# NOTE the use of gnu99, because otherwise the socket structures are not included
#  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12024703/why-cant-getaddrinfo-be-found-when-compiling-with-gcc-and-std-c99
CFLAGS = -Wall -g -std=gnu99 -pedantic -D MG_ENABLE_HTTP_STREAMING_MULTIPART -D MG_ENABLE_THREADS # -O2
# Options to use for the final linking process
# This one links the math library
LDLIBS = -lm

### The rules ###
# These should work for most projects without change
# Special variable meanings:
#   $@  = The name of the rule
#   $^  = All the requirements for the rule
#   $<  = The first required file of the rule

# Default rule
all: $(MONGOOSE)

# Rule to make the mongoose program
$(MONGOOSE): $(MONGOOSE).o $(OBJECTS)
	$(CC) $^ -o $@ $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)

# Specific rule to compile mongoose.c. It includes lots of warnings, we decided to ignore them.
MONGOOSE_LIBRARY = -w
mongoose.o: mongoose.c
	$(CC) $(MONGOOSE_LIBRARY) -o $@ -c $<

# Rule to make the object files
%.o: %.c $(DEPENDS)
	$(CC) $< -c -o $@ $(CFLAGS)

# Clear the compiled files
clean:
	rm -rf *.o $(MONGOOSE)

# Create a zip with the source code of the project
# Useful for submitting assignments
# Will clean the compilation first
zip: clean
	zip -r $(MAIN).zip *

# Indicate the rules that do not refer to a file
.PHONY: clean all zip
